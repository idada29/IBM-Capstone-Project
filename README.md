# IBM-Capstone-Project

The goal of this project is to forecast if the Falcon 9 first stage will successfully land. SpaceX, the case study company, advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website for 62 million dollars, compared to upwards of 165 million dollars for other suppliers; much of the savings is due to SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage. As a result, if we can figure out if the first stage will land, we can figure out how much a launch will cost. If another firm wishes to compete with SpaceX for a rocket launch, this information can be used.

The project's end-to-end scope includes data extraction using web scraping and the SpaceX API, database querying of cleansed data from the IBM cloud database, visualisation using matplotlib and folium via an interactive dashly platform, and machine learning model predictions.
