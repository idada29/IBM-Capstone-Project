# IBM-Capstone-Project

The goal of this project is to forecast if the Falcon 9 first stage will successfully land. SpaceX, the case study company, advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website for 62 million dollars, compared to upwards of 165 million dollars for other suppliers; much of the savings is due to SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage. As a result, if we can figure out if the first stage will land, we can figure out how much a launch will cost. If another firm wishes to compete with SpaceX for a rocket launch, this information can be used.
